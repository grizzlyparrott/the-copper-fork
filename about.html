  The Copper Fork – about page

  This page tells the story of the restaurant and its philosophy.
  It begins with a banner image and then provides two sections
  describing the history and culinary ethos. Use of headings
  creates clear structure, and the same navigation appears
  across all pages for consistency.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2025 in Bullhead City, Arizona, The Copper Fork was born
          from a passion for honest cooking and a desire to bring a modern
          American bistro to our community. What started as a family dream has
          blossomed into a vibrant restaurant where locals and travellers alike
          gather to share memorable meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose our name to reflect the beauty of the Southwest: copper
          represents Arizona’s rich mining heritage, while the fork celebrates
          our dedication to great food. Our team works tirelessly to create
          dishes that balance comfort with creativity.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that food should be as fresh as it is flavourful. That’s
          why we partner with local farmers, butchers and bakers to source
          seasonal ingredients. We cook from scratch – from house‑made sauces
          to desserts – and avoid shortcuts that compromise quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          At The Copper Fork we strive to create a warm, inviting atmosphere
          where everyone feels welcome. Whether you’re celebrating a milestone
          or just popping in for lunch, our goal is to make you feel at home
          while enjoying a memorable meal.
